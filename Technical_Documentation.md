# **BudgetTracker – Technical Documentation**

## Overview

**Purpose:** BudgetTracker is an ASP.NET Core solution that tracks accounts, transactions, categories, and budgets. The Web application serves both the Razor UI and the REST API routes from one host. It also provides AI-based saving advice using the 1minAI API.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Manage accounts, categories, transactions, and budgets.
- Generate dashboard summaries (balances, income/expense, top categories, budget progress).
- Expose REST endpoints for core entities and reports.
- Provide AI advice with caching and a simple prompt flow.

**Tech Stack:**

- .NET 10, ASP.NET Core MVC + attribute-routed API controllers
- EF Core with SQLite
- Repository + Service layers
- Typed HttpClient for AI integration
- Memory cache for insights

## High-Level Architecture

`Browser/API Client -> Web Controllers -> Services -> (Repositories -> DbContext) -> SQLite`
`                               |`
`                               -> InsightsService -> IGeminiClient (1minAI)`

### Layers

| Layer | Key Types | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Presentation** | `HomeController`, Razor Views, API Controllers in `BudgetTracker.Web` | Handle user input and API requests, return views/JSON |
| **Application** | `AccountService`, `TransactionService`, `BudgetService`, `DashboardService`, `InsightsService` | Orchestrate domain logic, validation, and caching |
| **Integration** | `GeminiClient` (1minAI), `IGeminiClient` | AI HTTP calls (create conversation, send prompt), parse JSON |
| **Persistence** | `BudgetTrackerDbContext`, EF repositories | Read/write entities, enforce unique constraints |
| **Configuration** | `Program.cs` (Web/API) | Register DI, DbContext, HttpClient, and middleware |

---

## Configuration & Secrets

- 1minAI API key is read from environment:

```bash
export ONEMINAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export ONEMINAI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
```

- SQLite uses the default connection string in appsettings.
- Migrations live in `BudgetTracker.Core`.

---

## Data Persistence

- **Entities:** `Account`, `Transaction`, `Category`, `Budget`.
- **DbContext:** `BudgetTrackerDbContext` exposes `DbSet<>` for each entity.
- **Constraints:** unique account names, unique category names, and one budget per category per month.
- **Seed Data:** default categories are inserted on first run in development.

---

## Request Flow (Web UI)

1. User opens the dashboard (`HomeController.Index`).
2. Controller loads accounts and renders the view.
3. User submits "Ask Gemini" form.
4. `InsightsService.GetAdviceAsync` shapes the prompt, caches results, calls `IGeminiClient`.
5. `GeminiClient` creates a 1minAI conversation and posts the prompt.
6. UI renders AI response or error details.

---

## Request Flow (API)

1. Client calls `/api/...` endpoints (Accounts, Transactions, Categories, Budgets, Reports, Dashboard).
2. API controllers validate inputs and delegate to services.
3. Services query EF repositories and return DTOs.

---

## Key Implementation Details

- **DI composition:** services and repositories are registered as scoped in `Program.cs`.
- **EF Core migrations:** executed on startup in development to keep the DB updated.
- **Caching:** insights are cached for 30 minutes to reduce AI calls.
- **AI provider:** implemented in `GeminiClient`, currently backed by 1minAI endpoints.
- **SQLite:** used for local persistence; a seed step inserts default categories.

## Running Locally

Web UI and API:

```bash
dotnet run --project BudgetTracker/BudgetTracker.Web
```

---

## Tests

```bash
dotnet test BudgetTracker/BudgetTracker.Tests/BudgetTracker.Tests.csproj
```
